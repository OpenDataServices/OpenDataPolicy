## Open data context
What is open data and why are Macc working with it?


### What is open data?
Macc subscribe following definition of open data:

  
Open data is data that can be freely used, reused and redistributed by anyone.  

It is subject only, at most, to the requirement to attribute and sharealike.

Open data are the building blocks of open knowledge. 

Open knowledge is what open data becomes when it’s useful, usable and used.

  

### Why open data?
Macc are committed to a strong community and voluntary sector in Manchester.  We believe that open data can assist with this ambition, through enabling transparency of our actions, in the form of open data.

  

### Our open data goals
When publishing data about our work, Macc have three main aims:

  
That our data is useful

We wish to publish data that brings value to those building a stronger community and voluntary sector.

  
That our data is meaningful

We wish to publish data that adds to the ongoing dialogue and discussion about the sector.

  
That our data is accessible

We wish to publish data in an open and accessible way, and provide regular narrative and understanding to the stakeholders.

  
In this context, Macc aim to operate an open data policy that is robust and practical, leading to greater engagement in the issues faced by the community and voluntary sector in Manchester.

  

## Our open data commitments
What is meant by open data at Macc?

  
When considering open data at Macc, we commit to the following:

  

### We will publish data openly

* We will provide documentation and descriptions of the data we publish, including a licence.



  

### We will use open data

* We will analyse, utilise and discuss our own data


* We will utilise other openly available datasets to provide insight into the voluntary sector of Manchester.



  

### We will support those using our data
When making our data openly available, we maintain a set of expectations, known as our Code of Conduct.  If you utilise open data published by Macc, we request that you consider this.

  

### We will support the sector with open data
In our work with voluntary sector organisations across the City of Manchester, we will provide advice and guidance in terms of publishing and using open data.

  
  
This policy provides information relevant to each of these commitments.  We describe the key aspects, actions and mechanisms that we use to deliver our open data policy.

  
  
  


  

## Publishing open data at Macc
How will Macc publish open data?

## Using open data at Macc
How will Macc utilise open data?

  

### Our use of open data sets
  
Alongside publishing our own datasets, Macc wishes to take an active role in the analysis and discussion of the insights that can be gleaned.  

  
For this reason, we will establish the following as part of our open data policy.

  

### Data release blog
Alongside the formal notes and documentation on our datasets, we will maintain a blog on the main Macc website, providing narrative and information on data being released and updated.

  

### Data analysis blog
In the same forum, Macc staff will provide a form of analytical / visualisation of Macc datasets - to provide insight and stimulate discussion.

  

### Using other datasets
When we utilise other datasets in our commentary and analysis, we will always provide clear attribution and guidance as to the source of the data, and any actions we may have taken.

  
See also: Macc attribution checklist (Appendix 1)

  

### Comments
In the provision of our blog and commentary, we will be open to comments and discussion, which will be published alongside any posts.  These will always be moderated, in accordance with our Code of Conduct.

Macc encourage others to access, use and discuss our open data.  We strive towards a strong community and voluntary sector in the City of Manchester, and value the contributions and insights that can be gleaned through use of data.

  
When doing so, we would hope the following basic Code of Conduct is observed:

* make an application that pretends to be from the Macc organisation;
