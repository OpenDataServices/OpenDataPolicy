## Open data context
What is open data and why are we working with it?


### What is open data?
We subscribe to the following definition of open data:

>
> Open data is data that can be freely used, reused and redistributed by anyone.  
>
> It is subject only, at most, to the requirement to attribute and sharealike.
>
> Open data are the building blocks of open knowledge. 
>
> Open knowledge is what open data becomes when it’s useful, usable and used.


### Why open data?
We are committed to a strong community and voluntary sector in |place|. We believe that open data can assist with this ambition, through enabling transparency of our actions, in the form of open data.


### Our open data goals
When publishing data about our work, we have three main aims:

* That our data is useful  
    We wish to publish data that brings value to those building a stronger community and voluntary sector.

  
* That our data is meaningful  
    We wish to publish data that adds to the ongoing dialogue and discussion about the sector.

  
* That our data is accessible  
    We wish to publish data in an open and accessible way, and provide regular narrative and understanding to the stakeholders.

In this context, we aim to operate an open data policy that is robust and practical, leading to greater engagement in the issues faced by the community and voluntary sector in |place|.


## Our open data commitments
What is meant by open data at |organisation name|?


When considering open data, we commit to the following:

### We will publish data openly

* We will publish data on key aspects of our activities in an open and accessible manner.
* We will update this data regularly and often.
* We will provide documentation and descriptions of the data we publish, including a licence.

### We will use open data

* We will analyse, utilise and discuss our own data
* We will utilise other openly available datasets to provide insight into the voluntary sector of |place|.

### We will support those using our data
When making our data openly available, we maintain a set of expectations, known as our Code of Conduct. If you utilise open data published by us, we request that you consider this.

### We will support the sector with open data
In our work with voluntary sector organisations across the |place|, we will provide advice and guidance in terms of publishing and using open data.

This policy provides information relevant to each of these commitments. We describe the key aspects, actions and mechanisms that we use to deliver our open data policy.


## Publishing open data
How will we publish open data?

### Our principles and best practices
  
The act of providing open data is to publish and share. We understand that this involves responsibility and due diligence.

When we publish data openly, our aim is to ensure it is of a quality to be accessed, used and understood. In doing so, we place the following expectations on our data publication.

It can often be the case that whilst data is made available openly, it is poorly structure, out-of-date, bad quality amongst other aspects. It is the intention of this policy to mitigate against such factors, via these criteria.

Note: these best practices should be read alongside our open data workflows and checklists. Together, these describe our expectations and methodologies.

## Using open data
How will we utilise open data?

### Our use of open data sets
Alongside publishing our own datasets, we wish to take an active role in the analysis and discussion of the insights that can be gleaned.  

For this reason, we will establish the following as part of our open data policy.
### Data release blog
Alongside the formal notes and documentation on our datasets, we will maintain a blog on our main website, providing narrative and information on data being released and updated.

### Data analysis blog
In the same forum, our staff will provide a form of analytical / visualisation of our datasets - to provide insight and stimulate discussion.

### Using other datasets
When we utilise other datasets in our commentary and analysis, we will always provide clear attribution and guidance as to the source of the data, and any actions we may have taken.

See also: Attribution checklist (Appendix 1)

### Comments
In the provision of our blog and commentary, we will be open to comments and discussion, which will be published alongside any posts. These will always be moderated, in accordance with our Code of Conduct.

See also: Open data feedback mechanisms (Appendix 1)


## Data use Code of Conduct
What do we expect from those who use our data?

### Our expectations of you
We encourage others to access, use and discuss our open data. We strive towards a strong community and voluntary sector in the |place|, and value the contributions and insights that can be gleaned through use of data.

When doing so, we would hope the following basic Code of Conduct is observed:

### Accessing our data
Much of the datasets we publish are succinct and easily available for download. When accessing our data, we request that you do not place unnecessary burden on our servers by making repeated data requests over a short period of time.

### Attribution
When using our data, we request that our licence is observed.  

When producing any material that uses our data, please ensure an attribution to |organisation name| is included.

### Derivation
When making use of our data, always state any steps that were made to undertake calculations or analysis that are not present in the source.

### Violations
When using our data, you must not:

* make an application that pretends to be from the |organisation name| organisation;
* present the data in a misleading or incorrect manner or to misrepresent or change the data;
* use this site for party political purposes, as the site paid for with public money so it is not appropriate to engage in party-political activity here;
* use the data in or to support a criminal or illicit activity;
* use the data on an application to inflame or make comments that are racist, sexist or homophobic, or which promote or incite violence or illegal activity.

### Discussion
We encourage discussion of our data, and the uses. In doing so, particularly in our online forums, we request you are respectful of others.

### Feedback
If you spot any mistakes, errors or points for clarification, please feedback via our designated channels.

We also encourage requests and ideas for new data that we may publish. Again, please do so via our feedback channels.


## Appendix 1: Open data workflows
The following workflows and checklists are used by our staff in the preparation, publication and update of open data. These are linked to our open data best practices, detailed in our open data policy. Over time, we will update and enhance these workflows. 

The results of all these process will always be detailed in the data release table for the relevant dataset. An example of this is listed in Appendix 2.

### Data privacy
When preparing any data for publication, we would always undertake the following:

  <table>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>Consideration</td>
        <td>Action</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Does the data contain names of individuals?</td>
        <td>If yes, then remove</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Does the data contain any unique identifiers that can be used to retrieve personal information from external systems?</td>
        <td>If yes, then remove</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

### Data quality criteria
When preparing data for publication, we would always undertake the following:

  <table>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>Consideration</td>
        <td>Action</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>For data that is aggregated, check the results for any outliers </td>
        <td>
          Check source data / reports to validate figures.</td></tr><tr><td>For any dataset, check for any blank fields or zero results.</td>
        <td>
          If numerous, check source data.<br/>
          If acceptable, then record in data release table.</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

### Data segmentation
When preparing data for publication, we would always undertake the following:

  <table>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>Consideration</td>
        <td>Action</td></tr><tr><td>For any dataset, consider the overall physical file size</td>
        <td>If over 10MB, then check contents and consider further segmentation</td></tr><tr><td>For any dataset, check the column headers and data labels are legible.</td>
        <td>If not, provide lookup file and note in data release table</td></tr><tr><td>For aggregated datasets, check that aggregations are explained and logged.</td>
        <td>Ensure these are documented in data release table</td></tr><tr><td>For any dataset, check that time periods used are in accordance with common standards (eg: financial quarters, calendar months)</td>
        <td>If there is a bespoke date range, then detail in data release table</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

### Data codes checklist
When preparing data for publication, we will always consider the following:

            Local authority<br/>
            Ward<br/>
            Clinical Commissioning Groups
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Provide and/or signpost data users to the latest lookup of any codes used.</td>
        <td>
          In the case of administrative geographic regions, refer to authoritative sources such as Ordnance Survey, Office for National Statistics and the NHS.
      </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>When using internal / |organisatiin name| specific codes, ensure that a lookup and/or explanation is provided.</td>
        <td>Log this in the data release table.</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

### Data formats checklist

        <td>
          Release as:<br/>
          Open Document Format for spreadsheets (.odf)<br/>
          Comma Separated Format for flat files (.csv)<br/>
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>When working with other data standards and systems, ensure that the format is open and accessible.</td>
        <td>Consider XML, JSON or RDF formats as open. Check with standard or publication organisation.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Avoid publishing data in closed, proprietary and formats that make the data inaccessible.</td>
        <td></td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

### Open data licence
When publishing data, we will always ensure a relevant licence is provided.  

Our default licence is a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-SA 4.0)

        </td>
        <td>
          If yes, then ensure this is in the data release table.<br/>
          If no, then select alternative, and document accordingly.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Does the data contain any information that is derived from other sources?</td>
        <td>
          If yes, then detail these sources in the data release table.<br/>
          If there may be an issue with these derivations, then seek advice.
        </td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

### Data publication schedule
When publishing - and updating - data, we will always seek to ensure that this is done in a timely manner.

  <table>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>Consideration</td>
        <td>Action</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>
          <p>For datasets that are updated periodically, ensure this takes place within acceptable timeframe.</p>
          <p>Guidance:<br/>
              Monthly updates - two weeks after period ends<br/>
              Quarterly updates - one month after period ends<br/>
              Annual updates - three months after period ends 
          </p>
        </td>
        <td>If data publication is outside of these thresholds, update/add to data release table</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Ensure that relevant older data can be accessed after an update - that it is not deleted or destroyed.</td>
        <td>
          For ongoing statistics, ensure the new time period data is made available alongside other periods.<br/>
          Where data must be overwritten, document in data release table. 
        </td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

### Open data publishing channels
When publishing data openly, we will always check the following:

  <table>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>Consideration</td>
        <td>Action</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>
          When creating data files, check the file name is logical, descriptive and devoid of any inconsistencies. eg:<br/>
          volunteers_statistics.csv<br/>
          rather than<br/>
          volunteersstats(1)-EDITED.csv
        </td>
        <td>Use the shared naming convention wherever possible: 'location-dataset-format-main.csv' (example 'oxfordshire-groups-openvcs-main.csv')</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>When hosting data files, always ensure that the end URL is accessible, and free from any security barriers, passwords or blocks.</td>
        <td>If there is an issue in terms of accessing the URL to the data file, seek advice.</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

### Open data feedback mechanisms
When seeking, collecting and receiving feedback on our data, we will always consider the following:

  <table>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>Consideration</td>
        <td>Action</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>When an "Issue" is posted via online forums (such as GitHub), respond accordingly - even if acknowledgement.</td>
        <td>
          Where the issue can be progressed, respond accordingly.<br/>
          If no action can be applied immediately, respond accordingly.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>
          When feedback is received via settings such as face-to-face meetings or workshops, consider how best to add this to existing feedback.
        </td>
        <td>
          Where appropriate, create a new Issue for the relevant dataset, attributing the source of the observation / remark.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>When comments are made about our usage of open data, respond according to the Code of Conduct.</td>
        <td></td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

### Attribution checklist
When using datasets published by other organisations, we will always ensure the following attribution considerations are provided within the context of any material we produce.  

  <table>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>Attribution</td>
        <td>Comment</td>
