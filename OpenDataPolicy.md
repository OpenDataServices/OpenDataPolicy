Open data context
-----------------

### What is open data?

We subscribe to the following definition of open data:

-   Open data is data that can be freely used, reused and redistributed by anyone.

-   It is subject only, at most, to the requirement to attribute and sharealike.

-   Open data is the building block of open knowledge.

-   Open knowledge is what open data becomes when it’s useful, usable and used.

### Why open data?

We are committed to building a strong \[sector\] in \[place\]. We believe one way we can do this is by making our actions transparent when we publish our activities as open data.

### Our open data goals

When publishing data about our work, we have three main aims:

-   That our data is open, useful, meaningful and accessible.

-   That we publish data that brings value, provides ongoing dialogue and discussion to those building a stronger \[sector\].

-   That we provide regular narrative and understanding to the stakeholders.

In this context, we aim to operate an open data practice that is robust, and leads to greater engagement on the issues faced by the \[sector\] in \[place\].

Our open data commitments
-------------------------

When considering open data, we commit to the following:

### We will publish data openly

-   We will publish data on key aspects of our activities in an open and accessible manner.

-   We will update this data regularly and in a timely manner.

-   We will provide documentation and descriptions of the data we publish, including a licence.

### We will use open data

-   We will analyse, use and discuss our own data

-   We will use other openly available datasets to provide insight into the \[sector\] of \[place\].

### We will support those using our data

-   We will be open to queries and feedback

-   Where appropriate, we will respond accordingly

### We will support the sector with open data

-   We will provide advice and guidance on publishing and using open data to peer organisations in \[sector\]

-   Where possible, we will champion the publishing and use of open data in the \[sector\]

This policy provides information relevant to each of these commitments. We describe the key aspects, actions and mechanisms that we use to deliver our open data policy.

Our open data principles
------------------------

The act of providing open data is to publish and share. We understand that this involves responsibility and due diligence. When we publish data openly, our aim is to ensure it is of a high enough quality to be accessed, used and understood. It is the intention of this policy to reduce potential issues that make data less useful.

*Note: these principles should be read alongside our open data workflows and checklists. Together, these describe our expectations and methodologies.*

### Principle 1
